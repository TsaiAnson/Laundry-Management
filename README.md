# Laundry-Managment
System designed to manage washers and dryers for a college. ID needed to register for a time slot. Time slot code needed to check-in and cancel time slots.
Sample Student ID’s: 02020, 12345, 99999

#### Let’s Get Started!

To run, simply run `java LaundryDriver`

#### Home Screen
Here, we are able to sign up, check in, as well as cancel a reservation. To Sign Up, use one of the sample student ID's listed above, and then choose the desired time slot. When it is time for your reservation, use enter the given code unique to the reservation to check in! Similarly, use the same code if you wish to cancel your time slot.

#### Small Note
Now, you're probably asking, Why did I make this? It was just a fun little idea I had after noticing that finding an available washer and a dryer can be rather difficult during busy hours. Additionally, I programmed this in a way where it can be easily modified to manage something else, such as hotel reservations.
